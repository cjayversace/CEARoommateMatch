We created survey and python program to create a "compatibility score" for any two possible roommates. It considers over 30 different aspects of a roommate, such as common interests and living habits, etc. 


The program analyzed the unformatted text in the existing spreadsheet, and comapred the similarity of different rommate's entries to create a "compatibility score". It awarded weighted points for similar sleep schedules, music taste, majors. The program is targeted to CEA students

HowardCEA is the unformatted csv file of student responses, RoommateData is the compatibility scores. 
Roomate.py is the file that holds the survery program that calculates the compatibility score. Users can pick and choose who they contact from veiwing the live database csv files.
