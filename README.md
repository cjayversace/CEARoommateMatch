We created survey and python program to create a "compatibility score" for any two possible roommates. It considers over 30 different aspects of a roommate, such as common interests and living habits, etc. 


The program analyzed the unformatted text in the existing spreadsheet, and comapred the similarity of different rommate's entries to create a "compatibility score". It awarded weighted points for similar sleep schedules, music taste, majors, etc.

HowardCEA is the unformatted csv file of student responses, RoomateData is the compatibility scores
